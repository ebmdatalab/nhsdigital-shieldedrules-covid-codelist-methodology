    "The Chief Medical Officer has created two groups for different social distancing and shieling\n",
    "- “At Risk” – large group (circa 19 million) normally at risk from the flu - should practice strict social distancing\n",
    "- “At high risk” – a smaller sub-group (circa 1.5 million), defined by CMO – should practice complete social “shielding”\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"at risk\" is basically the flu register and NHS Digital have published their [methodology for high risk shielded patient list identification](https://digital.nhs.uk/coronavirus/shielded-patient-list/methodology). They provided the list as [BNF codes](https://ebmdatalab.net/prescribing-data-bnf-codes/) and following notebook generates codes compliant with the [NHS Dictionary of Medicines and Devices](https://ebmdatalab.net/what-is-the-dmd-the-nhs-dictionary-of-medicines-and-devices/) which is the local UK Snomed drug extension. This is the pure code list - logic needs to be applied which is detailed in the guidance."
